Hey y'all
I'm Midnight and I guess I'd say I'm organised chaos, or maybe unorganised peace. Yes, the latter. Like the nights sky. Still, quiet and in someways empty, yet full or scattered stars burning brightly like beautiful diamonds. Glitter. Comets dash through from time to time, but do they clash? and you may see an airbus flashing, but the birds are asleep now.
